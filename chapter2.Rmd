*Data wranling and analysis of student 2014*

 

- First I produced the needed subset of the original data.
 #Johdatus yhteiskuntatilastotieteeseen, syksy 2014
(Introduction to Social Statistics, fall 2014 - in Finnish),
international survey of Approaches to Learning from http://www.helsinki.fi/~kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-data.txt
The following code does this and creates an analysis dataset with the variables gender, age, attitude, deep, stra, surf and points by combining questions in the learning2014 data and excludes observations where the exam points variable is zero.


```{r} 
learning2014 <- read.table("http://www.helsinki.fi/~kvehkala/JYTmooc/JYTOPKYS3-data.txt", sep="\t", header=TRUE)
str(learning2014)
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
deep_questions <- c("D03", "D11", "D19", "D27", "D07", "D14", "D22", "D30","D06",  "D15", "D23", "D31")
surface_questions <- c("SU02","SU10","SU18","SU26", "SU05","SU13","SU21","SU29","SU08","SU16","SU24","SU32")
strategic_questions <- c("ST01","ST09","ST17","ST25","ST04","ST12","ST20","ST28")
deep_columns <- select(learning2014, one_of(deep_questions))
learning2014$deep <- rowMeans(deep_columns)


surface_columns <- select(learning2014, one_of(surface_questions))
learning2014$surf <- rowMeans(surface_columns)

strategic_columns <- select(learning2014, one_of(strategic_questions))
learning2014$stra <- rowMeans(strategic_columns)

keep_columns <- c("gender","Age","Attitude","deep","stra","surf","Points")
learning2_2014 <- select(learning2014, one_of(keep_columns))
str(learning2_2014)

learning2_2014 <- subset(learning2_2014, Points>0) #chooses the set within in the set by Points above 0
str(learning2_2014)
getwd()

setwd("IODS-project/data/")
?write.csv  
write.csv(learning2_2014, file = "data1.csv") 
```
Deep learning questions are like this: " I usually set out to understand for myself the meaning of what we have to learn." 
Surface learning exercises are like this: " I find I have to concentrate on just memorising a good deal of what I have to learn."
Strategic learning exercies are like this: "  I think I'm quite systematic and organised when it comes to revising for exams."

The actual data looks like this: 
```{r} 
str(learning2_2014)
```

The dataset has 166 observations and 7 variables.

# part two 

Then I continued to the actual analysis exercise

I read the data from the csv filed produced in the previous exercise and printed the summary

```{r} 
learning2014 <- read.csv("/Users/Tuomassoila/IODS-project/data/data1.csv")
str(learning2014) 
```
Then I printed the overview of the dataset 
```{r} 

library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
#draws fancy scatter plot matrix
str(learning2014$age)
p <- ggpairs(learning2014, mapping = aes(col = gender, alpha = 0.3), lower =  list(combo =wrap("facethist",bins =20)))
p
```

Show a graphical overview of the data and show summaries of the variables in the data. Describe and interpret the outputs, commenting on the distributions of the variables and the relationships between them. (3 points)



None of the variables above have a big correlation between each other and the biggest correlation is not above 0.1. 

Age distribution is skewed towards young. Attitude is somewhat different between men and women. Women's disctribution is more normal than men's but neither is quite normally distributed. Deep variable is more normal yet but still not quite and a little skewed towards higher score. Stra variable quite normally distributed already. Then again surf is far from normally distributed among men and quite normal for women. Poins variable is skewed towards higher score.


#Part 3
I chose three variables for the multiple regression analysis: stra + Attitude and  Age. 
```{r} 
# creates a multiple linear regression model 
my_model <- lm(Points ~ stra + Attitude + Age, data = learning2014 )

summary(my_model) #prings the summary of the multiple linear regression analysis
```
With the above results. 

Strategic learning contributes to explaining Points gotten so it will stay in the model. So does Attitude but age's affect is not statictically significant so It will be removed. 
```{r} 
my_model <- lm(Points ~ stra + Attitude, data = learning2014 ) #now only stra and attitude are set as explanatory variables
summary(my_model)
```
# Part 4

Even with this adjustment the model is quite poor in explaining the points gotten. The Adjusted R-squared value is only 0.1446, which means that the model can only explain 14.5% of the variability around the mean. 

# part 5

Then I produced the following diagnostic plots:Residuals vs Fitted values, Normal QQ-plot and Residuals vs Leverage. 

```{r} 
par(mfrow = c(2,2)) # sets the plot in same image
plot(my_model, which=c(1,2,5)) #draws the plot number: 1,2,5 bt which command from the plot list
```
When the normal Q-Q plot is examined we can see that the normality there is some doubt about the normality since the lower and upper part does fit really well on the linear line. 

On the residuals vs. fitted the distribution is reasonably random so the size of the errors do not depend on the explanatory variables. 

Residuals vs leverage reveald which observations have the highest impact. In the plot we can see there are no single values that have and unausally high impact on the model.
